Hi Seung:

To use Vim for commit messages:

You start in Command Mode in Vim. Press I to go into Insert mode.

Type your message as you like


When finished, type <Esc> to go back into Command Mode.


Then, to save and quit use :x or :wq in Command Mode


To abandon a commit message use :q! instead
